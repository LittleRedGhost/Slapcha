# Slapcha
Slim and Lite Capcha Idea

Files:

index.html -> calls capcha-demo.php

capcha-demo.php -> appallingly HTML, without a shred of PHP - I separated things in the end. Calls “Capcheck” and “Capcha” from...

capcha-inc.js -> 4 Javascript functions, including AJAX request, Capcheck, and Capcha.

capcha-check.php -> Tiny file to perform the check of the Capcha with its MD5 friend.

capcha.php -> Main file where the font is defined and the Capcha table is created.


sineboy.html -> Some daft little maze idea I had; and subsequently forgot about.
